## Recommended Mods
- **[Celestial Tint](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/sfDesat/Celestial_Tint/)** by **sfDesat** - For an amazing view of space outside the windows.

OR
- **[Ship Windows 4K Skybox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/veri/ShipWindows_4K_Skybox/)** by **veri** - For a higher definition space skybox. This does not work with Celestial Tint.
